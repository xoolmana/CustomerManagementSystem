## Purpose
<p>The final project consists of programming and implementing an advanced Java application that demonstrates database connectivity with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on relational database tables using a GUI interface. The application requires a login to the database (Sakila in MySQL), with GUI forms using Swing for a main interface and selections for creating, reading, updating and deleting records from tables in Sakila, and a report.</p><br>

## Project Features
The login screen is directly linked to the SQL database. It checks through the database users/passwords and ensures it is correct, instead of the users being hard-coded into Netbeans. <br>

The main menu also includes a "Dark Mode" button that changes the theme colors of each page. Good for when you don't want the brightness from the white burning your eyes! The mode is implemented throughout every page and is consistent even when exiting back to the main menu.
